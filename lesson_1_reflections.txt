How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because the diff show only the lines was modified, not all the content, so is much more simple to find the bug.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
